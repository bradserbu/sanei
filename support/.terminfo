# tic -o outputdir .terminfo
# A screen- based TERMINFO that declares the escape sequences
# enabled by the tmux config "set-window-option -g xterm-keys".
#
# Prefix the name with xterm- since some applications inspect
# the TERM *name* in addition to the terminal capabilities advertised.
xterm-screen-256color|GNU Screen with 256 colors bce and tmux xterm-keys,

# As of Nov'11, the below keys are picked up by
# .../tmux/blob/master/trunk/xterm-keys.c:
	kDC=\E[3;2~, kEND=\E[1;2F, kHOM=\E[1;2H,
	kIC=\E[2;2~, kLFT=\E[1;2D, kNXT=\E[6;2~, kPRV=\E[5;2~,
	kRIT=\E[1;2C,

# Some names are extensions allowed by ncurses, e.g.,
#       kDN, kDN5, kDN6, kLFT5, kLFT6, kRIT5, kRIT6, kUP, kUP5, kUP6
#
# The uppercase names are made up, since there are no standards that apply.
# If they were limited to two characters, they could in principle be translated
# to termcap.  However, termcap sizes are limited to 1023 bytes, so there is
# little point in ensuring that extended key names can be translated to
# termcap.  A terminfo file can be up to 4096 bytes; using all extended keys
# that xterm can generate would in fact exceed that limit.
#
# The numbers correspond to the modifier parameters documented in Xterm
# Control Sequences:
#
#       2       Shift
#       3       Alt
#       4       Shift + Alt
#       5       Control
#       6       Shift + Control
#       7       Alt + Control
#       8       Shift + Alt + Control
#
# X/Open Curses defines some shift combinations, which are also used here
# where applicable.  Since it does define some shift combinations, no number
# (2) is used for suffixing the made-up names.  Some combinations are not
# useful, e.g., they may reboot your computer, or they may require too many
# fingers.  I stopped at modifier 7, just to keep things simple -TD
#
# XTerm resources:
# ---------------
# The xterm+pcfn, xterm+pcf0, xterm+pcf1, xterm+pcf2 and xterm+pcf3 fragments
# correspond to default resource settings for xterm on a 104-key PC keyboard
# with 12 function-keys:
#
#       *sunKeyboard:false
#       *oldXtermFKeys:false
#       *modifyCursorKeys:2
#       *modifyFunctionKeys:2
#       *ctrlFKeys:10
#
# The key numbers are computed based on the modifiers:
#
#       kf1-kf12 are F1-F12
#       kf13-kf24 are shift F1-F12
#       kf25-kf36 are control F1-F12
#       kf37-kf48 are control+shift F1-F12
#       kf49-kf60 are alt F1-F12
#       kf61-kf63 are shift-alt F1-F3
#
# Note that ncurses would allow definition of kf64 and beyond, if there were
# an application that required it.
